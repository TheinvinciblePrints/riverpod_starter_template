# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architectural approach used in this Flutter Riverpod application.

## Core Architecture Layers

Our application follows a layered architecture pattern with these key components:

### 1. UI Layer (Presentation)
- **Purpose**: Handle user interface, display data, and capture user input
- **Components**: Screens, Widgets, Controllers
- **Files Location**: `lib/src/features/*/presentation/`

### 2. Application Layer (Use Cases) 
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate business logic, validate inputs, coordinate repositories
- **Components**: Services, Use Cases
- **Files Location**: `lib/src/features/*/application/`

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Purpose**: Define business models and business rules
- **Components**: Entities, Value Objects
- **Files Location**: `lib/src/features/*/domain/`

### 4. Data Layer
- **Purpose**: Handle data operations and external services
- **Components**: Repositories, Data Sources
- **Files Location**: `lib/src/features/*/data/`

## Key Benefits of Our Architecture

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns
- UI is separated from business logic
- Business logic is independent from data sources
- Each layer has a specific responsibility

### 2. Testability
- Each layer can be tested independently
- Dependency injection allows for mocking components
- Business logic tests don't require UI or infrastructure

### 3. Maintainability
- Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others
- New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
- Code is organized in a consistent, predictable way

### 4. Scalability
- New features follow the same architectural pattern
- Team members can easily understand the code structure
- The application can grow without becoming unwieldy

## Architecture Flow

1. **User Interaction**: UI components capture user actions
2. **Controllers**: UI controllers invoke application services
3. **Application Layer**: Services validate inputs and coordinate with repositories
4. **Repositories**: Handle data operations, caching, and API calls
5. **Response**: Data flows back up through the layers to update the UI

## Example Flow: Authentication

1. User enters credentials and taps Login button
2. `AuthenticationController` captures the action
3. Controller calls `AuthService.login()`
4. `AuthService` validates credentials and calls `AuthRepository`
5. `AuthRepository` makes API call and handles tokens/caching
6. Result flows back to update UI state

## When to Add New Layers

The architecture can be adjusted based on the complexity of the feature:

- **Simple Feature**: UI → Controller → Repository
- **Complex Feature**: UI → Controller → Application → Repository

Add an application layer when:
- Business logic becomes complex
- Multiple repositories need to be coordinated
- Input validation and business rules increase in complexity
